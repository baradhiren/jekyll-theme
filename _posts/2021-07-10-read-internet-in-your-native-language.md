I believe language to be one of the major reasons people feel constrained exposing themselves to new ideas. They don't read or explore their ideas because most of the content to deep dive in is not available in their local languages or the ones they know.

So, In this article I wanted to share a nifty way to convert any article to your native language.

To follow this you will need a smart phone and Chrome browser installed.

1. On your Android phone or tablet, open the Chrome app.

2. Go to settings.

3. Select Languages.

5. Click on Three dots besides your added language and select Offer to Translate.

6. Open the webpage you want to translate into your language.

You can achieve the same results on your laptop or desktop if you have Chrome browser installed. Refer to the [documentation from Google here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB&oco=1).
